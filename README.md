## Set Seed Edit
This is an edit of Duncans AutoResetMod that allows for Set Seed speedruns as well as Random Seed. Everything below this section is from the original mod. Anything unique to this mod will be in this section.

Before you do anything, make sure you delete the original version of the mod and the old attempts.txt. (The mod currently lumps together both set and random seed attempts, this will most likely be changed in the future.)

To use the set seed aspect of the mod, click the seeds, input your seed, and then click the diamond boots. Now whenever you quit it will automatically create a new world with your given seed. To stop resetting it's the same as with Duncans original mod. To use the random seed aspect, just click the golden boots.

This mod is not officially allowed for runs on http://speedrun.com/mc and its category extensions. If you submit a run there using this it will be denied. 


## Usage

Press the golden boots button on the main menu to start the world resetting mode.

To reset, simply leave the world (either the normal save and quit or the fast reset button).

To exit the resetting mode, press the "Stop Resets & Quit" button at the bottom left of the options menu.

## Info and Compatibility

This mod is valid for speedruns on http://speedrun.com/mc and its category extensions.

For 1.16.1, Closet Witch's Fast Reset mod is compatible (https://github.com/jan-leila/FastReset/releases).

Note for resource pack creators: the "Stop Resets & Quit" button can be changed by customizing menu.stop_resets in your language file if you like.
